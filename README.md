# vscode-cpp-raw-string-highlighter

Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for [C++ raw string literals](https://abseil.io/tips/64). This was inspired by my time writing js with [vscode-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components) and motivated by my use of cpp raw strings at work.

## Install

The extension will be listed on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) as well as the MS official extension store when it is in a functional state.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for styled components in JavaScript and TypeScript.
- IntelliSense powered by vscode's language support for the configured language
- Configurable tag language mappings for your own cpp raw string conventions

## Usage

Forthcoming.
